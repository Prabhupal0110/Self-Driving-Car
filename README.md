# Self-Driving-Car
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) was used to map the raw pixels from a front-facing camera to the steering commands for a self-driving car. The ML model was trained with the dataset which was created using Udacity simulator. 
Each frame of the captured image was annotated with the steering angle. This dataset containg images was fed to ML model.
Once the model was trained, the validation was done again using Udacity self driving car simulator where the autonomous mode was selected.
